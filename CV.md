-   Propose a general Bayesian Framework and proves its optimality under certain metrics.

-   This framework inspires an EM style algorithm which largely improves computational efficiency and scalability by avoiding back-propagation computation during meta-update.

-   Provide a nice summary on a variety of related work under this framework and inspire other unexplored possible algorithms from it.

Yayi Zou, Tony Qin, <span>*Value-based Bayesian Meta-reinforcement Learning and Traffic Signal Control*</span>, (Submitted to AAAI 2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00163>

-   Propose a novel value-based Bayesian meta-reinforcement learning framework BM-DQN to robustly speed up the learning process in new traffic signal control scenarios by utilizing well-trained prior knowledge learned from existing scenarios.

-   This framework is based on our proposed fast-adaptation variation to Gradient-EM Bayesian Meta-learning and the fast update advantage of DQN. It achieves fast adaptation to new scenarios with continual learning ability and robustness to uncertainty.

## INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE

<span>**Didichuxing AI Lab @Silicon Valley, Research Scientist**</span>

-   **Offline Reinforcement Learning based User Growth System under Budget Constraint**

    -   In growth system such as ads display, content recommendation, and coupon binding, only offline training is feasible in most practical scenarios.

    -   Propose a value-based batch-constrained RL which restricts the action space in order to force the agent towards behaving close to data-collection policy.

    -   Solve a global integer programming optimization to decide the policy over all users under budget constraint.

-   **Multi-task Learning System for Customizing Information Feed**

    -   Utilize the similarity of Information Feed tasks (such as ads/activity display, coupon binding etc.) of different customer groups to enhance its performance on each customer group.

    -   Propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Model and solve it with EM algorithm.

-   **Large Scale Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Vehicle Dispatching System**

    -   Vehicle order-dispatching is a challenging multi-agent RL problem due to the enormous number of agents where traditional centralized or decentralized methods become intractable.

    -   By applying mean-field approximation to reduce the complexity we propose a centralized training/decentralized execution method that is suitable for large scale vehicle dispatching.
