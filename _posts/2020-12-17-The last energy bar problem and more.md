# The last energy bar 

## problem 

In your backpack, there are two flavors of energy bars: A and B. Each day you eat at least one energy bar, by doing the following procedure:

1. Randomly draw an energy bar and eat it.
2. Randomly draw another energy bar:
- if its flavor is the same as before, then eat it and repeat step 2.
- if its flavor is different, then put it back and call it a day.

Given that you have m As and n Bs on the first day, what is the probability that, your last energy bar is B (which happens some time in the future)?
