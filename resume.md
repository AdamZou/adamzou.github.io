-   Propose a general Bayesian Framework and proves its optimality under
    certain metrics.

-   This framework inspires an EM style algorithm which largely improves
    computational efficiency and scalability by avoiding
    back-propagation computation during meta-update.

-   Provide a nice summary on a variety of related work under this
    framework and inspire other unexplored possible algorithms from it.

**Bayesian Meta-DQN Traffic Signal Control**\
Yayi Zou, Tony Qin, *Value-based Bayesian Meta-reinforcement Learning
and Traffic Signal Control*, (Submitted to AAAI 2021)
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00163>

-   Propose a novel value-based Bayesian meta-reinforcement learning
    framework BM-DQN to robustly speed up the learning process in new
    traffic signal control scenarios by utilizing well-trained prior
    knowledge learned from existing scenarios.

-   This framework is based on our proposed fast-adaptation variation to
    Gradient-EM Bayesian Meta-learning and the fast update advantage of
    DQN. It achieves fast adaptation to new scenarios with continual
    learning ability and robustness to uncertainty.

**Discrete Choice Models in Revenue Management**\
Yayi Zou, Huseyin Topaloglu, *Two-stage Discrete Choice Model* ,
(unpublished manuscript)

-   Model customers choice behavior over different product assortments
    such as Markov Chain Choice Model and Two-stage Choice Model over
    probit, nested logit, mixture of MNL.

-   Propose an EM-algorithm to estimate model parameters from observed
    data for Two-stage Choice Model over multinomial logit (MNL).

-   Propose approximate optimization algorithms (e.g. PTAS, FPTAS, and
    Constant-Factor Approximation Algorithm) to calculate the assortment
    with optimal expected revenue.

**First Principle Computation of materials**\
Yayi Zou, Craig Fennie

-   Use Density Functional Theory (a fixed point theory based ab-initio
    computation method) to predict various properties of different
    materials.

-   Use group theory to calculate the distortion modes in crystals such
    as perovskite.

-   **Offline Reinforcement Learning based User Growth System under
    Budget Constraint**

    -   In growth system such as ads display, content recommendation,
        and coupon binding, only offline training is feasible in most
        practical scenarios.

    -   Propose a value-based batch-constrained RL which restricts the
        action space in order to force the agent towards behaving close
        to data-collection policy.

    -   Solve a global integer programming optimization to decide the
        policy over all users under budget constraint.

-   **Multi-task Learning System for Customizing Information Feed**

    -   Utilize the similarity of Information Feed tasks (such as
        ads/activity display, coupon binding etc.) of different customer
        groups to enhance its performance on each customer group.

    -   Propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Model and solve it with EM
        algorithm.

-   **Large Scale Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Vehicle Dispatching
    System**

    -   Vehicle order-dispatching is a challenging multi-agent RL
        problem due to the enormous number of agents where traditional
        centralized or decentralized methods become intractable.

    -   By applying mean-field approximation to reduce the complexity we
        propose a centralized training/decentralized execution method
        that is suitable for large scale vehicle dispatching.
